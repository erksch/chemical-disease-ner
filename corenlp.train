Thus O
, O
clinicians O
should O
address O

The O

The O
newer O

Since O

the O

Concurrent O

produced O
massive O

no O

Although O
the O
explanation O

from O

In O

we O
investigated O
the O

that O

the O
effect O

suggests O
that O
vitamin O

may O
induce O

through O
its O

Because O

had O
no O

produced O
by O
vitamin O
D O
, O
the O
synergy O
between O
Warfarin O

is O
probably O

explained O
by O
the O
hypothesis O
that O
Warfarin O

CASE O
SUMMARIES O
: O
Two O
patients O
developed O
prolonged O
cholestatic Disease
hepatitis O
after O
receiving O
ticlopidine O
following O
percutaneous O
coronary O
angioplasty O
, O

DISCUSSION O
: O
Cholestatic O
hepatitis O
is O
a O
rare O
complication O
of O
the O
antiplatelet O
agent O
ticlopidine O
; O
several O
cases O
have O
been O
reported O
but O
few O
in O
the O
English O
literature O
. O
Our O
patients O
developed O
jaundice O
following O
treatment O
with O
ticlopidine O
and O
showed O
the O
clinical O
and O
laboratory O
characteristics O
of O
cholestatic Disease
hepatitis O
, O
which O
resolved O
after O
discontinuation O
of O
the O
drug O
. O
Hepatitis O
may O
develop O
weeks O
after O
discontinuation O
of O
the O
drug O
and O
may O
run O
a O
prolonged O
course O
, O
but O
complete O
remission O
was O
observed O
in O
all O
reported O
cases O
. O
An O
objective O
causality O
assessment O
revealed O
that O
the O
adverse O
drug O
event O
was O
probably O
related O
to O
the O
use O
of O
ticlopidine O
. O
The O
mechanisms O
of O
this O
ticlopidine-induced O
cholestasis O
are O
unclear O
. O
Immune O
mechanisms O
may O
be O
involved O
in O
the O
drug O
's O
hepatotoxicity O
, O
as O
suggested O
by O
the O
T-cell O

CONCLUSIONS O
: O
Cholestatic O
hepatitis O
is O
a O
rare O
adverse O
effect O
of O
ticlopidine O
that O
may O
be O
immune O
mediated O
. O
Patients O

should O
be O
monitored O
with O

. O
This O
complication O
will O
be O
observed O
even O
less O
often O
in O
the O
future O
as O
ticlopidine O
is O
being O
replaced O

( O

) O
gabapentin O
suppressed O

this O
effect O

more O
robust O

the O

The O
observed O

effects O
were O
not O
due O

These O

a O
stronger O
antihyperalgesic O

evident O
in O

BACKGROUND O
: O
The O
mechanisms O
underlying O
heart Disease

by O
adriamycin O
are O
very O
complicated O
and O
still O
unclear O
. O
The O
aim O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
investigate O
whether O
autophagy O
was O
involved O
in O
the O
progression O
of O
heart Disease

induced O
by O
adriamycin O
, O
so O
that O
we O
can O
develop O
a O
novel O
treatment O
strategy O
for O

. O
METHODS O
: O
3-methyladenine O
( O

inhibitor O
on O
autophagy O
was O
used O
in O
a O
heart Disease

, O
an O
adriamycin-treated O
group O
, O
and O
a O
3MA O
plus O

We O
then O
examined O

and O
counted O
autophagic O

, O
we O
analyzed O
the O

RESULTS O
: O
3MA O
significantly O
improved O

. O
Furthermore O
, O
adriamycin O
induced O
the O
formation O

3MA O
strongly O
downregulated O
the O

METHODS O
: O
Using O

OBJECTIVE O
: O
The O
globus O

plays O
a O
critical O
role O
in O
movement O

. O
Previous O
studies O
have O
indicated O
that O
the O
globus O
pallidus O
receives O
neurotensinergic O
innervation O
from O
the O
striatum O
, O
and O
systemic O
administration O
of O
a O
neurotensin O
analog O
could O
produce O
antiparkinsonian O
effects O
. O
The O
present O
study O
aimed O
to O
investigate O
the O
effects O
of O
pallidal O
neurotensin O
on O
haloperidol-induced O
parkinsonian Disease
symptoms O
. O
METHODS O
: O

of O
neurotensin O
into O
the O
globus O
pallidus O
reversed O
haloperidol-induced O
parkinsonian Disease

in O
rats O
. O
Electrophysiological O
recordings O
showed O
that O
microinjection O
of O
neurotensin O
induced O
excitation O
of O
pallidal O

considerations O

Clinical O
and O
experimental O
data O

suggest O
several O
possible O
mechanisms O
by O
which O
cocaine O
may O
result O
in O

. O
In O
individuals O
with O

. O
In O
other O
individuals O
with O
no O
underlying O
atherosclerotic O
obstruction O
, O
coronary O

may O
be O
due O
to O
spasm O
, O
thrombus O
, O
or O
both O
. O
With O
regard O
to O
spasm O
, O
the O
clinical O
findings O
are O
largely O
circumstantial O
, O
and O
the O
locus O
of O
cocaine-induced O
vasoconstriction O
remains O
speculative O
. O
Although O
certain O
clinical O
and O
experimental O
findings O
support O
the O
hypothesis O
that O
spasm O
involves O
the O
epicardial O
, O
medium-size O
vessels O
, O
other O
data O
suggest O
intramural O
vasoconstriction O
. O
Diffuse O
intramural O
vasoconstriction O
is O
not O
consistent O
with O
reports O
of O
segmental O
, O
discrete O
infarction O
. O
Whereas O
certain O
in O
vivo O
data O
suggest O
that O
these O
effects O
are O
alpha-mediated O
, O
other O
in O

data O
suggest O
the O
opposite O
. O
The O
finding O
of O
cocaine-induced O
vasoconstriction O
in O
segments O
of O
( O
noninnervated O
) O
human O
umbilical O
artery O
suggests O
that O
the O
presence O
or O
absence O
of O

not O
sufficient O

comparison O

Six O
epidemiologic O
studies O
in O
the O
United O
States O
and O
Europe O
indicate O
that O
habitual O
use O
of O
phenacetin O
is O
associated O
with O
the O
development O
of O
chronic Disease
renal O
failure O
and O
end-stage O
renal O
disease O
( O
ESRD O
) O
, O
with O
a O
relative O
risk O
in O
the O
range O
of O
4 O
to O
19 O
. O
As O
a O
result O
of O
these O
and O
other O
studies O
, O
phenacetin O
has O
now O
been O
withdrawn O
from O
the O
market O
in O
most O
countries O
. O
However O
, O
three O
case O
control O
studies O
, O
one O
each O
in O
North O
Carolina O
, O
northern O
Maryland O
, O
and O
West O
Berlin O
, O
Germany O
, O
showed O
that O
habitual O
use O
of O
acetaminophen O
is O
also O
associated O
with O
chronic Disease
renal O
failure O
and O
ESRD O
, O
with O
a O
relative O
risk O
in O
the O
range O
of O
2 O
to O
4 O
. O
These O
studies O
suggest O
that O
both O
phenacetin O
and O
acetaminophen O
may O
contribute O
to O
the O
burden O
of O
ESRD O
, O
with O
the O
risk O
of O
the O
latter O
being O
somewhat O
less O
than O
that O
of O
the O
former O
. O
This O
apparent O
difference O
in O
risk O
may O
not O
be O
due O
to O
differences O
in O
nephrotoxic O
potential O
of O
the O
drugs O
themselves O
. O
A O
lower O
relative O
risk O
would O
be O
expected O
for O
acetaminophen O
if O
the O
risk O
of O
both O
drugs O
in O
combination O
with O
other O
analgesics O
was O
higher O
than O
the O
risk O
of O
either O
agent O
alone O
. O
Thus O
, O
acetaminophen O
has O
been O
used O
both O
as O
a O
single O
agent O
and O
in O
combination O
with O
other O
analgesics O
, O
whereas O
phenacetin O
was O
available O
only O
in O
combinations O
. O
The O
possibility O
that O
habitual O
use O
of O
acetaminophen O
alone O
increases O
the O
risk O
of O
ESRD O
has O
not O
been O
clearly O
demonstrated O
, O
but O
can O
not O
be O
dismissed O

primarily O
of O
arteriolopathy O

suggests O
that O

In O

was O
also O
able O
to O
prevent O

At O
the O
highest O

, O
PG-9 O
did O
not O
produce O
any O
collateral O
symptoms O
as O
revealed O
by O

it O
did O

PG-9 O
was O
also O
able O

increase O
the O
amount O
of O
NGF O
secreted O
in O

by O
astrocytes O
in O
a O

manner O
. O
The O
maximal O
NGF O
contents O
obtained O
by O
PG-9 O
were O
17.6-fold O
of O
the O
control O
value O
. O
During O
culture O
, O
no O
morphological O
changes O
were O
found O
at O
effective O

PG-9 O

The O
current O
work O

the O
ability O
of O
PG-9 O
to O
induce O
beneficial O
effects O
on O
cognitive O
processes O
and O
stimulate O

Over O
the O

We O

Sirolimus-associated Chemical
proteinuria Disease
and O
renal Disease
dysfunction O
. O
Sirolimus O
is O
a O
novel O
immunosuppressant O
with O
potent O
antiproliferative O
actions O
through O
its O
ability O
to O
inhibit O
the O
raptor-containing O
mammalian O
target O
of O
rapamycin O
protein O
kinase O
. O
Sirolimus O
represents O
a O
major O
therapeutic O
advance O
in O
the O
prevention O
of O
acute O
renal Disease
allograft O
rejection O
and O
chronic O
allograft O
nephropathy O
. O
Its O
role O
in O
the O
therapy O
of O
glomerulonephritis O
, O
autoimmunity O
, O
cystic O
renal Disease
diseases O
and O
renal Disease
cancer O
is O
under O
investigation O
. O
Because O
sirolimus O
does O
not O
share O
the O
vasomotor O
renal Disease
adverse O
effects O
exhibited O
by O
calcineurin O
inhibitors O
, O
it O
has O
been O
designated O
a O
'non-nephrotoxic O
drug O
' O
. O
However O
, O
clinical O
reports O
suggest O
that O
, O
under O
some O
circumstances O
, O
sirolimus O
is O
associated O
with O
proteinuria O
and O
acute O
renal Disease
dysfunction O
. O
A O
common O
risk O
factor O
appears O
to O
be O
presence O
of O
pre-existing O
chronic O
renal Disease
damage O
. O
The O
mechanisms O
of O
sirolimus-associated O
proteinuria O
are O
multifactorial O
and O
may O
be O
due O
to O
an O
increase O
in O
glomerular O
capillary O
pressure O
following O
calcineurin O
inhibitor O
withdrawal O
. O
It O
has O
also O
been O
suggested O
that O
sirolimus O
directly O
causes O
increased O
glomerular O
permeability/injury O
, O
but O
evidence O
for O
this O
mechanism O
is O
currently O
inconclusive O
. O
The O
acute O
renal Disease
dysfunction O
associated O
with O
sirolimus O
( O
such O
as O
in O
delayed O
graft O
function O
) O
may O
be O
due O
to O
suppression O
of O
compensatory O
renal Disease
cell O
proliferation O
and O
survival/repair O
processes O
. O
Although O
these O
adverse O
effects O
occur O
in O
some O
patients O
, O
their O
occurrence O
could O
be O
minimised O
by O
knowledge O
of O
the O
molecular O
effects O
of O
sirolimus O
on O
the O
kidney O
, O
the O
use O
of O
sirolimus O
in O
appropriate O
patient O
populations O
, O

using O
sirolimus O

Progressive O
myopathy Disease
with O
up-regulation O
of O
MHC-I O
associated O
with O
statin Chemical
therapy O
. O
Statins Chemical
can O
cause O
a O
necrotizing O
myopathy Disease
and O
hyperCKaemia Disease
which O
is O
reversible O
on O
cessation O
of O
the O
drug O
. O
What O
is O
less O
well O
known O
is O
a O
phenomenon O
whereby O
statins Chemical
may O
induce O
a O
myopathy Disease
, O
which O
persists O
or O
may O
progress O
after O
stopping O
the O
drug O
. O
We O
investigated O
the O
muscle O

in O
8 O
such O
cases O
. O
All O
had O
myofibre O
necrosis Disease
but O
only O
3 O
had O
an O

In O
all O
cases O
there O
was O
diffuse O
or O
multifocal O
up-regulation O

even O
in O
non-necrotic Disease

Progressive O

cases O
after O
commencement O
of O
prednisolone Chemical

methotrexate Chemical
, O
and O
in O
one O
case O
spontaneously O
. O
These O
observations O
suggest O
that O
statins Chemical
may O
initiate O
an O
immune-mediated O
myopathy Disease
that O
persists O
after O
withdrawal O
of O
the O
drug O
and O
responds O
to O
immunosuppressive O
therapy O
. O
The O
mechanism O
of O
this O
myopathy Disease
is O
uncertain O
but O
may O
involve O
the O
induction O
by O

of O
an O

INTERPRETATION O
: O
Repeated O
exposure O

TAM O
induces O
hemolysis O

The O

samples O

Despite O
inducing O
extensive O
erythrocyte O

, O
TAM O
does O
not O
shift O
the O
osmotic O
fragility O
curves O
of O
erythrocytes O
. O
The O
hemolytic O
effect O
of O
TAM O
is O
prevented O
by O
low O
concentrations O
of O
alpha-tocopherol O
( O
alpha-T O
) O
and O
alpha-tocopherol O
acetate O
( O

indicating O
that O
TAM-induced O
hemolysis O
is O
not O
related O
to O
oxidative O
membrane O
damage O
. O
This O
was O
further O
evidenced O
by O
absence O

and O
hemoglobin O
oxidation O
both O
determined O
in O
parallel O
with O
TAM-induced O

Furthermore O
, O
it O
was O
observed O
that O
TAM O
inhibits O
the O
peroxidation O
of O
human O
erythrocytes O
induced O
by O
AAPH O
, O
thus O
ruling O
out O
TAM-induced O
cell O
oxidative O
stress O
. O
Hemolysis O
caused O
by O
TAM O
was O
not O
preceded O
by O
the O
leakage O

from O
the O

also O
excluding O

colloid-osmotic O
type O
mechanism O

hemolysis O
, O
according O
to O
the O

However O
, O

release O

peripheral O
proteins O

cytosol O
proteins O
essentially O
bound O

. O
Either O
alpha-T O
or O
alpha-TAc O
increases O
membrane O
packing O
and O
prevents O
TAM O
partition O
into O
model O
membranes O
. O
These O
effects O
suggest O
that O
the O
protection O
from O
hemolysis O
by O
tocopherols O
is O
related O
to O
a O
decreased O
TAM O
incorporation O
in O
condensed O
membranes O
and O
the O
structural O
damage O
of O
the O
erythrocyte O
membrane O
is O
consequently O
avoided O
. O
Therefore O
, O
TAM-induced O
hemolysis O
results O
from O
a O
structural O
perturbation O
of O
red O
cell O
membrane O
, O
leading O
to O
changes O
in O
the O
framework O
of O
the O
erythrocyte O
membrane O
and O
its O
cytoskeleton O
caused O
by O
its O
high O
partition O
in O
the O

. O
These O
defects O
explain O
the O
abnormal O
erythrocyte O

and O
decreased O
mechanical O
stability O
promoted O
by O
TAM O
, O
resulting O
in O
hemolytic O
anemia O
. O
Additionally O
, O
since O

final O
stage O
of O
cytotoxicity O
, O
the O
disruption O

the O

Surprisingly O
, O
the O
first O

Both O

We O
found O
that O

METHODS O
: O
We O
conducted O
a O

action O
to O
manage O

CONCLUSIONS O
: O
Topical O

BACKGROUND O
: O
Sirolimus Chemical
is O
the O
latest O
immunosuppressive O
agent O
used O
to O
prevent O
rejection O
, O
and O
may O
have O
less O
nephrotoxicity Disease
than O
calcineurin O
inhibitor O
( O

) O

regimens O
. O
To O
date O
there O
has O
been O
little O
documentation O
of O
clinically O
significant O
proteinuria Disease
linked O
with O
the O
use O
of O
sirolimus Chemical
. O
We O
have O
encountered O
several O
patients O
who O
developed O
substantial O
proteinuria Disease
associated O
with O
sirolimus Chemical
use O
. O
In O
each O
patient O
, O
the O
close O
temporal O
association O
between O
the O
commencement O
of O
sirolimus Chemical
therapy O
and O
proteinuria Disease
implicated O
sirolimus Chemical
as O
the O
most O
likely O
etiology O
of O
the O
proteinuria Disease
. O
METHODS O
: O
We O
analyzed O
the O
clinical O
and O
laboratory O
information O
available O
for O
all O
119 O
patients O
transplanted O
at O
the O
Washington O
Hospital O
Center O
between O
1999-2003 O
for O
whom O
sirolimus Chemical
was O
a O
component O
of O
their O
immunosuppressant O
regimen O
. O
In O
these O
patients O
, O
the O
magnitude O
of O
proteinuria Disease
was O
assessed O
on O

Laboratory O
results O
were O

and O
following O
sirolimus Chemical
use O
. O
RESULTS O
: O
Twenty-eight O
patients O
( O
24 O
% O
) O
developed O
increased O
proteinuria Disease
from O
baseline O
during O
their O
post-transplantation O
course O
. O
In O
21 O
patients O
an O
alternative O
cause O
of O
proteinuria Disease
was O
either O
obvious O
or O
insufficient O
data O
was O
available O
to O
be O
conclusive O
. O
In O
7 O
of O
the O
28 O
patients O
there O
was O
a O
striking O
temporal O
association O
between O
the O
initiation O
of O
sirolimus Chemical
and O
the O
development O
of O
nephrotic-range Disease
proteinuria Disease
. O
Proteinuria Disease
correlated O
most O
strongly O
with O
sirolimus Chemical
therapy O
when O
compared O
to O
other O
demographic O
and O
clinical O
variables O
. O
In O
most O
patients O
, O
discontinuation O
of O
sirolimus Chemical
resulted O
in O
a O
decrease O
, O
but O
not O
resolution O
, O
of O
proteinuria Disease
. O
CONCLUSIONS O
: O
Sirolimus Chemical
induces O
or O
aggravates O
pre-existing O
proteinuria Disease
in O
an O
unpredictable O
subset O
of O
renal O
allograft O

. O
Proteinuria Disease
may O
improve O

This O

, O
neurocognitive O
and O

PERSPECTIVE O
: O
Study O
findings O
indicate O
that O
the O

physical O
side O
effects O
of O

oxycodone O
are O
similar O
for O

. O
Therefore O
, O
clinicians O
should O
not O
avoid O
prescribing O
oral O
opioids O
to O
older O
adults O
based O
on O
the O
belief O
that O

to O
help O
dental O
practitioners O
recognize O

patients O
who O
may O
be O
abusing O

. O
Dental O
practitioners O
also O
may O
be O
skeptical O
about O
the O
reliability O
of O

, O
as O
they O
frequently O

When O
they O
do O
occur O
they O
are O
often O
unrecognized O
because O

when O
significant O
may O
pose O
a O
risk O
to O
both O
the O

that O
may O
be O
encountered O
in O

reminds O
us O
that O
when O

OBJECTIVES O
: O
The O
United O
Kingdom O
Parkinson O

Disease O
Research O
Group O
( O

) O
trial O
found O
an O
increased O
mortality O
in O
patients O
with O
Parkinson O

disease O
( O
PD O
) O
randomized O
to O
receive O
10 O
mg O
selegiline O
per O
day O
and O
L-dopa O
compared O
with O
those O
taking O
L-dopa O
alone O
. O
Recently O
, O
we O
found O
that O
therapy O
with O
selegiline O
and O
L-dopa O
was O
associated O
with O
selective O
systolic O
orthostatic O
hypotension O
which O
was O
abolished O
by O
withdrawal O
of O
selegiline O
. O
This O
unwanted O
effect O
on O
postural Disease
blood O
pressure O
was O
not O
the O
result O
of O
underlying O
autonomic O
failure O
. O
The O
aims O
of O
this O
study O
were O
to O
confirm O
our O
previous O
findings O
in O
a O
separate O
cohort O
of O
patients O
and O
to O
determine O
the O
time O
course O
of O
the O
cardiovascular O
consequences O
of O
stopping O
selegiline O
in O
the O
expectation O
that O
this O
might O
shed O
light O
on O
the O
mechanisms O
by O
which O
the O
drug O
causes O
orthostatic O
hypotension O
. O
METHODS O
: O
The O
cardiovascular O
responses O
to O
standing O
and O
head-up O
tilt O
were O
studied O
repeatedly O
in O
PD O
patients O
receiving O
selegiline O
and O
as O
the O
drug O
was O
withdrawn O
. O
RESULTS O
: O
Head-up O
tilt O
caused O
systolic O
orthostatic O
hypotension O
which O
was O
marked O
in O
six O
of O
20 O
PD O
patients O
on O
selegiline O
, O
one O
of O
whom O
lost O
consciousness O
with O
unrecordable O
blood O
pressures O
. O
A O
lesser O
degree O
of O
orthostatic O
hypotension O
occurred O
with O
standing O
. O
Orthostatic O
hypotension O
was O
ameliorated O
4 O
days O
after O
withdrawal O
of O
selegiline O
and O
totally O
abolished O
7 O
days O
after O
discontinuation O
of O
the O
drug O
. O
Stopping O
selegiline O
also O
significantly O
reduced O
the O
supine O
systolic O
and O
diastolic O
blood O
pressures O
consistent O
with O
a O
previously O
undescribed O
supine O
pressor O
action O
. O
CONCLUSION O
: O
This O
study O
confirms O
our O
previous O
finding O
that O
selegiline O
in O
combination O
with O
L-dopa O
is O
associated O
with O
selective O
orthostatic O
hypotension O
. O
The O
possibilities O
that O
these O
cardiovascular O
findings O
might O
be O
the O
result O

Despite O
the O
underlying O
diseases O
, O
the O
prognosis O
for O

is O
good O
because O
it O

The O

accounts O
for O
a Disease
major O
part O
of O
the O
underlying O
neurophysiology O
of O

. O
Because O
drug-induced O

only O
be O
considered O

we O
can O
avoid O

appeared O
after O
intravenous O

400 O
mg O
of O
procainamide O
for O
the O
treatment O
of O

. O
In O
the O
remaining O
three O

, O
procainamide O
was O
administered O
orally O
for O
treatment O
of O
chronic O
premature O
ventricular Disease

These O
patients O
had O
Q-T O

In O
four O

In O
two O

In O
the O

, O
despite O

The O
aim O

to O
evaluate O
the O
relationship O
between O
phenytoin Chemical

in O
patients O
who O
had O
experienced O

. O
Five O
females O
and O
6 O
males O
, O
21-59 O
years O

, O
were O
examined O
with O
a O
1.5-T O
whole-body O
system O
using O
a O
circular O
polarized O
head O

. O
Conventional O
spin O
echo O
images O
were O
acquired O
in O
the O

In O

, O
we O
performed O
a O
high-resolution O
3D O
gradient O
echo O
, O
T1-weighted O
sequences O
at O
a O
1-mm O
slice O
thickness O
. O
The O
images O
were O
subsequently O
processed O
to O
obtain O
volumetric O
data O
for O
the O
cerebellum O
. O
Cerebellar O
volume O
for O
the O
patient O
group O
ranged O
between O
67.66 O

sets O
from O
10 O
healthy O
male O
and O
10 O
healthy O
female O
age-matched O

were O
used O
to O
compare O
cerebellar Disease
volumes O

Using O
linear O
regression O
we O
found O
that O
no O
correlation O
exists O
between O
seizure O
duration O
, O
elevation O
of O
phenytoin O

However O
, O
multiple O
regression O
for O
the O
daily O

, O
duration O
of O
phenytoin O
treatment O
and O
cerebellar Disease
volume O
revealed O
a O
correlation O
of O
these O
parameters O
. O
We O
conclude O
that O
phenytoin O
overdosage O
does O
not O
necessarily O
result O
in O
cerebellar Disease
atrophy O
and O
it O
is O
unlikely O
that O
phenytoin O
medication O
was O
the O
only O
cause O
of O
cerebellar Disease

in O
the O

Although O
there O
was O
a O
discrepancy O
between O
the O
amount O
of O
cTnI O

, O
probably O
due O
to O

. O
BACKGROUND O
: O
Fibrin O
sealants O
( O
FS O
) O
derived O
from O
human O
plasma O
are O
frequently O
used O
in O
neurosurgery O
. O
In O
order O
to O
increase O
clot O
stability O
, O
FS O
typically O
contain O
aprotinin O
, O
a O
natural O
fibrinolysis O
inhibitor O
. O
Recently O
, O
synthetic O
fibrinolysis O
inhibitors O
such O
as O
tranexamic O
acid O
( O
tAMCA O
) O
have O
been O
considered O
as O
substitutes O
for O
aprotinin O
. O
However O
, O
tAMCA O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
cause O
epileptic O
seizures O
. O
We O
wanted O
to O
study O
whether O
tAMCA O
retains O
its O
convulsive O
action O
if O
incorporated O
into O
a O
FS O
. O
METHOD O
: O
FS O
containing O
aprotinin O
or O
different O
concentrations O
of O
tAMCA O
( O
0.5-47.5 O
mg/ml O
) O
were O
applied O
to O
the O
pial O
surface O
of O
the O
cortex O
of O
anaesthetized O
rats O
. O
The O
response O
of O
the O
animals O
was O
evaluated O
using O
electroencephalography O
and O
by O
monitoring O
the O
clinical O
behaviour O
during O
and O
after O
recovery O
from O
anaesthesia O
. O
FINDINGS O
: O
FS O
containing O
tAMCA O
caused O
paroxysmal O
brain O
activity O
which O
was O
associated O
with O
distinct O
convulsive O
behaviours O
. O
The O
degree O
of O
these O
seizures O
increased O
with O
increasing O
concentration O
of O
tAMCA O
. O
Thus O
, O
FS O
containing O
47.5 O
mg/ml O
tAMCA O
evoked O
generalized O
seizures O
in O
all O
tested O
rats O
( O
n=6 O
) O
while O
the O
lowest O
concentration O
of O
tAMCA O
( O
0.5 O
mg/ml O
) O
only O
evoked O
brief O
episodes O
of O
jerk-correlated O
convulsive O
potentials O
in O
1 O
of O
6 O
rats O
. O
In O
contrast O
, O
FS O
containing O
aprotinin O
did O
not O
evoke O
any O
paroxysmal O
activity O
. O
INTERPRETATION O
: O
Tranexamic O
acid O
retains O
its O
convulsive O
action O
within O
FS O
. O
Thus O
, O
use O
of O
FS O
containing O
tAMCA O
for O
surgery O
within O
or O
close O
to O
the O
CNS O
may O
pose O
a O
substantial O
risk O

BACKGROUND O
: O
Glioblastoma O
is O
a O
malignant O
tumor O
that O
occurs O
in O
the O
cerebrum O
during O
adulthood O
. O
With O
current O
treatment O
regimens O
including O

surgery O
, O

, O
the O
average O
life O
expectancy O
of O
the O
patients O
is O
limited O
to O
approximately O
1 O
year O
. O
Therefore O
, O
patients O
with O
glioblastoma O
sometimes O
have O
intracarotid O
injection O
of O
carcinostatics O
added O
to O
the O
treatment O
regimen O
. O
Generally O
, O
carboplatin O
is O
said O
to O
have O
milder O
side O
effects O
than O
cisplatin O
, O
whose O
ocular Disease
and O
orbital O
toxicity O
are O
well O
known O
. O
However O
, O
we O
experienced O
a O
case O
of O
severe O
ocular Disease
and O
orbital O
toxicity O
after O
intracarotid O
injection O
of O
carboplatin O
, O
which O
is O
infrequently O
reported O
. O
CASE O
: O
A O
58-year-old O
man O
received O
an O
intracarotid O
injection O
of O
carboplatin O
for O
recurrent O
glioblastomas O
in O
his O
left O
temporal O

. O
He O
complained O
of O
pain O
and O
visual O
disturbance O
in O
the O
ipsilateral O
eye O
30 O
h O
after O
the O
injection O
. O
Various O
ocular Disease
symptoms O
and O
findings O
caused O
by O
carboplatin O

were O
seen O
. O
RESULTS O
: O
He O
was O
treated O
with O

administration O
of O
corticosteroids O
and O
glycerin O
for O
6 O
days O
after O
the O
injection O
. O
Although O

diminished O

CONCLUSION O
: O
When O

if O

if O

This O

Our O

that O

cause O

Alpha-lipoic Chemical

it O
rescues O

In O
conclusion O
mitochondrial O
toxicity O
is O
an O
early O
common O
event O
both O
in O

All O

the O

suggests O
that O
a O

We O
conclude O
that O
the O

can O
induce O
hematotoxicity O

BACKGROUND O
: O
Cisplatin O
has O
minimal O
antitumor O
activity O
when O
used O
as O
second- O
or O
third-line O
treatment O
of O
metastatic O
breast Disease

% O
when O
60-120 O
mg/m2 O
of O
cisplatin O
is O
administered O

Although O
a O

associated O
with O

( O

Amifostine O
subsequently O
was O
shown O
to O
protect O

from O
the O
toxic O
effects O
of O
alkylating O
agents O
and O
cisplatin O
without O
decreasing O
the O
antitumor O
effect O
of O
the O
chemotherapy O
. O
Early O
trials O
of O

Based O
on O
the O
finding O
that O

protect O

the O

, O
the O

BACKGROUND O
: O
Recent O
evidence O
suggests O
that O
transient O
neurologic O
symptoms O
( O
TNSs O
) O
frequently O
follow O
lidocaine O
spinal O
anesthesia O

are O
infrequent O
with O
bupivacaine O
. O
However O
, O
identification O
of O
a O
short-acting O
local O
anesthetic O
to O
substitute O
for O
lidocaine O
for O
brief O
surgical O
procedures O
remains O
an O
important O
goal O
. O
Prilocaine O
is O
an O
amide O
local O
anesthetic O
with O
a O
duration O
of O
action O
similar O
to O
that O
of O
lidocaine O
. O
Accordingly O
, O
the O
present O
, O
prospective O
double-blind O
study O
compares O
prilocaine O
with O
lidocaine O
and O
bupivacaine O
with O
respect O
to O
duration O
of O

and O
relative O
risk O
of O

RESULTS O
: O
Nine O

CONCLUSIONS O
: O
Prilocaine O
may O
be O
preferable O
to O
lidocaine O
for O
short O
surgical O
procedures O
because O
it O
has O
a O

The O
role O
of O
nicotine Chemical
in O
smoking-related O
cardiovascular Disease
disease O
. O
Nicotine O
activates O
the O
sympathetic O
nervous O
system O
and O
in O
this O
way O
could O
contribute O
to O
cardiovascular Disease
disease O
. O
Animal O
studies O
and O
mechanistic O
studies O
indicate O
that O
nicotine O
could O
play O
a O
role O
in O
accelerating O
atherosclerosis O
, O
but O
evidence O
among O
humans O
is O
too O
inadequate O
to O
be O
definitive O
about O
such O
an O
effect O
. O
Almost O
certainly O
, O
nicotine O
via O
its O
hemodynamic O
effects O
contributes O
to O
acute O
cardiovascular Disease
events O
, O
although O
current O
evidence O
suggests O
that O
the O
effects O
of O
nicotine O
are O
much O
less O
important O
than O
are O
the O
prothrombotic O
effects O
of O
cigarette O
smoking O
or O
the O
effects O
of O
carbon O
monoxide O
. O
Nicotine O
does O
not O
appear O
to O
enhance O
thrombosis O
among O
humans O
. O
Clinical O
studies O
of O
pipe O
smokers O
and O
people O
using O
transdermal O
nicotine O
support O
the O
idea O
that O
toxins O
other O
than O
nicotine O
are O
the O
most O
important O
causes O
of O
acute O
cardiovascular Disease
events O
. O
Finally O
, O
the O
dose O
response O
for O
cardiovascular Disease
events O
of O
nicotine O
appears O
to O
be O
flat O
, O
suggesting O
that O
if O
nicotine O
is O
involved O
, O
adverse O
effects O
might O
be O
seen O
with O
relatively O
low-level O
cigarette O
exposures O

CONCLUSIONS O
: O
The O
venlafaxine O

PURPOSE O
: O
The O

is O
a O
drug O
efflux O

that O
is O

predominantly O
at O
the O

also O
to O
be O
expressed O
at O
the O

so O
that O
this O

very O
helpful O
in O
defining O

By O

study O
the O

of O
MRP2 O

, O
we O
recently O
reported O
that O
phenytoin Chemical

. O
However O
, O
one O
drawback O
of O
such O
studies O
in O
genetically O
deficient O
rats O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
compensatory O
changes O
with O
upregulation O
of O
other O
transporters O
can O
occur O
. O
This O
prompted O
us O
to O
study O
the O
brain O
expression O
of O
P-glycoprotein O
( O

) O
, O
a O
major O

RESULTS O
: O
Immunofluorescence O

No O

that O

CONCLUSIONS O
: O
The O
data O

that O

an O
important O
role O

Because O

that O

BACKGROUND/AIMS O
: O
Recently O
ribavirin O
has O
been O
found O
to O
inhibit O
angiogenesis O
and O
a O
number O
of O
angiogenesis O
inhibitors O
such O
as O
sunitinib O
and O
sorafenib O
have O
been O
found O
to O
cause O
acute O
hemolysis O
. O
We O
aimed O
to O
investigate O
whether O
there O
is O
a O
relation O
between O
hemoglobin O
, O
haptoglobin O
and O
angiogenesis O
soluble O
markers O
which O
are O
modifiable O
and O
can O
help O
in O
developing O
strategies O
against O

. O
METHODS O
: O
Fourteen O
patients O
chronically O
infected O
with O
hepatitis O
C O
virus O
were O
treated O
by O
pegylated O
interferon O
alpha O
2a O
and O
ribavirin O
. O
Serum O
hemoglobin O
, O
haptoglobin O
and O
angiogenesis O
markers O
of O
vascular O
endothelial O
growth O
factor O
and O
angiopoetin-2 O
were O
investigated O
before O
and O
after O
therapy O
. O
RESULTS O
: O
We O
observed O
a O
significant O
decrease O
in O
haptoglobin O
levels O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
treatment O
period O
. O
Hemoglobin O
levels O
also O
decreased O
but O
insignificantly O
by O
treatment O
. O
In O
contrast O
with O
the O
literature O
, O
serum O
levels O
of O
angiogenesis O
factors O
did O
not O
change O
significantly O
by O
pegylated O

therapy O
. O
We O
found O
no O
correlation O
of O
angiogenesis O
soluble O
markers O
with O
either O
hemoglobin O
or O
haptoglobin O
. O
CONCLUSION O
: O
This O
is O
the O
first O

in O
all O
the O

We O
suggest O
this O
mode O

were O
previously O
treated O
by O
drugs O

which O
subsides O

this O
complication O
, O
the O
marked O
slowing O

the O
electromyographic O
